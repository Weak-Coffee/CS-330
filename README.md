# How do I approach designing software?

I appreach software design by trying to learn something new and figure out the best possible way of accomplishing my goal based off industry best practices. My goal is to always be learning something and growing my skills. My design process is to research, figure out how people who came before me accomplished the same thing or something similar and how can I improve upon when they did. 
  
# How do I approach developing programs?

Working in 3D space can be challenging and requires a lot of itteration to make sure things look the way you desire. It is a long process of tweeking your code and running to see how those changes effect your program. Over the various projcets I gained a better understanding of how OPENGL works and was better able to vizualize the changes I had made without having to constatly run my code to check. 

# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

I have always been a creative person and was very excited for this class because it involved something I love, creating. I thing any kind of coding can help you grow and gain skills that are trasferable. Working with OPEGNGL allowed me to brush up on my coding skills since it had been quite some time since I had done any coding.
